<h1 align=center>Using the Meta Object Compiler</h1><br clear="all">
<p>
The Meta Object Compiler, moc among friends, is the program which
handles the <a href="metaobjects.html">C++ extensions in Qt.</a>
<p>
The moc reads a class declaration and produces a C++ source file
containing the names of all signals and slots for that class (and a
little more).  This C++ source file the moc outputs must be compiled
and linked with the implementation of the class (or it can be
#included into the source file).
<p>
Using the moc is introduced in <a href="t7.html">chapter 7</a> of the
Qt Tutorial.  Chapter 7 includes a simple <a href="t7-makefile.html">Makefile that uses the moc</a> and of course source code that
uses signals and slots.
<p>
<h2>Invoking moc</h2>
<p>
Here are the command-line options supported by the moc: 
<p>
<dl>
<dt> -o <var>file</var> <dd> Write output to <var>file</var> rather
than to stdout.
<dt> -f <dd> Force the generation of an #include statement in the
output.  This is the default for files whose name matches the regular
expression \.[hH][^.]* (ie. the extension starts with H or h).  This
option is only useful if you have header files that do not follow the
standard naming conventions.
<dt> -i <dd> Do not generate an #include statement in the output.
This may be used to run the moc on on a C++ file containing one or
more class declarations. You should then #include the meta object
code in the .cpp
file.  If both -i and -f are present, the last one wins.
<dt> -nw <dd> Do not generate any warnings.  Discouraged.
<dt> -ldbg <dd> Write a flood of lex debug information on stdout.
<dt> -dbg <dd> Treat all non-signal members as slots, for internal
debugging purposes.  This is not useful for programming Qt clients.
<dt> -p <var>path</var> <dd> Makes the moc prepend <var>path</var>/ to
the file name in the generated #include statement (if one is
generated).
<dt> -q <var>path</var> <dd> Makes the moc prepend <var>path</var>/ to
the file name of qt #include files in the generated code.
</dl>
<p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
moc is almost always invoked by make(1), not by hand.
<p>
<p>
moc is typically used with an input file containing class declarations
like this skeleton:
<pre>    class YourClass : public QObject {
        Q_OBJECT
    public:
        YourClass( <a href="qobject.html">QObject</a> * parent=0,
                              const char * name=0 );
        ~YourClass();

    signals:

    public slots:

    };
</pre>
<p>
<p>
Here is a useful makefile rule if you only use GNU make:
<p>
<pre>    m%.cpp: %.h
            moc $&lt; -o $@
</pre>
<p>
<p>
If you want to write portably, you can use individual rules of the
following form:
<p>
<pre>    mNAME.cpp: NAME.h
            moc $&lt; -o $@
</pre>
<p>
<p>
You must also remember to add <var>mNAME.cpp</var> to your SOURCES
(substitute your favorite name) variable and <var>mNAME.o</var> to
your OBJECTS variable.
<p>
<p>
(While we prefer to name our C++ source files .cpp, the moc doesn't
know that, so you can use .C, .cc, .CC, .cxx or even .c++ if you
prefer.)
<p>
<p>
If you have class declarations in C++ files, we recommend that you use
a makefile rule like this:
<p>
<pre>    NAME.o: mNAME.cpp

    mNAME.cpp: NAME.cpp
            moc -i $&lt; -o $@
</pre>
<p>
<p>
This guarantees that make(1) will run the moc before it compiles
<var>NAME.cpp.</var> You can then put
<p>
<pre>    #include "nNAME.cpp"
</pre>
<p>
at the end of <var>NAME.cpp,</var> where all the classes declared in
that file are fully known.
<p>
<h2>Diagnostics</h2>
<p>
Sometimes you may get linkage errors, saying that
YourClass::className() is undefined or that YourClass lacks a vtbl.
Those errors happen most often when you forget to compile the
moc-generated C++ code or include that object file in the link
command.
<p>
<p>
The moc will warn you about a number of dangerous or illegal constructs.
<p>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>
The moc does not expand #include or #define, it simply skips any
preprocessor directives it encounters. This is regrettable, but is
normally not a problem in practice.
<p>
The moc does not handle all of C++.  The main problem is that class
templates cannot have signals or slots.  This is an important bug.  Here
is an example:
<p>
<pre>    class SomeTemplate&lt;int&gt; : public QFrame {
        Q_OBJECT
    [...]
    signals:
        void bugInMocDetected( int );
    };
</pre>
<p>
Less importantly, the following constructs are illegal.  All of them have
workarounds which we think are better alternatives, so fixing these bugs
is not a high priority for us.
<p>
<h3>Multiple inheritance requires QObject to be first</h3>
<p>
If you are using multiple inheritance, moc assumes that the <em>first</em>
inherited class is a subclass of QObject.  Also, be sure that <em>only</em>
the first inherited class is a QObject.
<p>
<pre>    class SomeClass : public QObject, public OtherClass {
    [...]
    };
</pre>
<p>
This bug is almost impossible to fix; since the moc does not expand
#include or #define, it cannot find out which one of the base classes is a
QObject.
<p>
<h3>Function pointers can not be arguments to signals or slots</h3>
<p>
In most cases where you would consider that, we think inheritance is a
better alternative.  Here is an example of illegal syntax:
<p>
<pre>    class someClass : public QObject {
        Q_OBJECT
    [...]
    public slots:
        void apply(void (*applyFunction)(<a href="qlist.html">QList</a>*, void*), char*);
    };
</pre>
<p>
You can work around this restriction like this:
<pre>    typedef void (*ApplyFunctionType)(<a href="qlist.html">QList</a>*, void*);

    class someClass : public QObject {
        Q_OBJECT
    [...]
    public slots:
        void apply( ApplyFunctionType, char *);
    };
</pre>
<p>
<p>
(It may sometimes be even better to replace the function pointer with
inheritance and virtual functions, signals or slots.)
<p>
<h3>Friend declarations can not be placed in signals or slots sections</h3>
<p>
Sometimes it will work, but in general, friend declarations can
not be placed in signals or slots sections.  Put them in the good old
private, protected or public sections instead.  Here is an example of
the illegal syntax:
<p>
<pre>    class someClass : public QObject {
        Q_OBJECT
    [...]
    signals:
        friend class ClassTemplate&lt;char&gt;;
    };
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Signals and slots cannot be upgraded</h3>
<p>
The C++ feature of upgrading an inherited member function to
public status is not extended to cover signals and slots.  Here is an
illegal example:
<p>
<pre>    class Whatever : public QButtonGroup {
    [...]
    public slots:
        void QButtonGroup::buttonPressed;
    [...]
    };
</pre>
<p>
The QButtonGroup::buttonPressed() slot is protected.
<p>
C++ quiz: What happens if you try to upgrade a protected member
function which is overloaded?
<ol>
<li> All the functions are overloaded.
<li> That is not legal C++.
<!-- C++ ARM, section r.11.3 -->
</ol>
<p>
<h3>Type macros can not be used for signal and slot arguments</h3>
<p>
Since the moc does not expand #define, type macros that take an argument
will not work in signals and slots. Here is an illegal example:
<p>
<pre>    #ifdef ultrix
    #define SIGNEDNESS(a) unsigned a
    #else
    #define SIGNEDNESS(a) a
    #endif

    class Whatever : public QObject {
    [...]
    signals:
        void someSignal( SIGNEDNESS(a) );
    [...]
    };
</pre>
<p>
A #define without arguments works.
<p>
<h3>Nested classes cannot be in the signals or slots sections nor have
signals or slots</h3>
<p>
Here's an example:
<p>
<pre>    class A {
        Q_OBJECT
    public:
        class B {
        public slots:
            void b();       // Nested class with slot
        [....]
        };
    signals:
        class B {
            void b();       // Nested class in signals:

        [....]
        }:
    };
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Constructors can not be used in signals or slots sections</h3>
<p>
It is a mystery to me why anyone would put a constructor on
either the signals or slots sections.  You can not, anyway (except
that it happens to work in some cases).  Put them in private,
protected or public sections, where they belong.  Here is an example
of the illegal syntax:
<p>
<pre>    class SomeClass : public QObject {
        Q_OBJECT
    public slots:
        SomeClass( <a href="qobject.html">QObject</a> *parent, const char *name )
            : <a href="qobject.html">QObject</a>( parent, name ) {}
    [...]
    };
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Signals and slots may not have default arguments</h3>
<p>
Since signal->slot binding occurs at run-time, it is
conceptually difficult to use default parameters, which are a
compile-time phenomenon.  This will fail:
<p>
<pre>    class SomeClass : public QObject {
        Q_OBJECT
    public slots:
        void someSlot(int x=100);
    };
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Signals and slots may not have template arguments</h3>
<p>
Declaring signals and slots with template-type parameters will not
work as expected, even though the moc will accept it. Connecting the
signal to the slot in the following example, the slot will not get
executed when the signal is emitted:
<p>
<pre>   [...]
   public slots:
       void MyWidget::setLocation (pair&lt;int,int&gt; location);

   [...]
   public signals:
       void MyObject::moved (pair&lt;int,int&gt; location);
</pre>
<p>
However, you can work around this limitation by explicitly typedef'ing
the parameter types, like this:
<p>
<pre>   typedef pair&lt;int,int&gt; IntPair;       
   [...]
   public slots:
       void MyWidget::setLocation (IntPair location);

   [...]
   public signals:
       void MyObject::moved (IntPair location);
</pre>
<p>
This will work as expected.
